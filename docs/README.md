# Documentation

Until we format this into documentation proper, these scattered markdown
files will serve to hold notes and documentation (that will be converted to
something prettier). Note that playground currently just works for docker,
and other backends are coming promptly!

 - [install](install.md): brief notes on installation steps
 - [concepts](concepts.md): concepts for a playground
 - [playground](cli.md): is documentation for the playground client.
